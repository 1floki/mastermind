This program emulates the original Mastermind board game. Learn more about the game here here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

Instructions for playing: 
1. Clone the repository and cd to the */mastermind folder.
2. Run *ruby main.rb* to play the game. (or use repl.it: https://replit.com/@FlokiProgrammer/mastermind#main.rb).
3. Choose either "Code Maker" role or "Code Breaker" role.
4. Instead of colors, this game uses combination of colors from 1111 to 6666. 
5. If you choose to be a code breaker, you'll have 12 attempts to successfuly guess the computer's randomly generated code. 
6. Each input will result in an output which may include X and/or Y.
7. X means that from the given string of numbers, one character exits in the code and is in the right place.
8. O means that the character exits, but it's location is not correct. 
9. If a character doesn't exit in the list, it will not be printed/included in the output. 
10. For "Code Maker", you'll be given an option to enter a number between 1111 to 6666. Similarly, the computer will be given 12 attemps to successfuy guess your selected code.

This project is part of The Odin Project that I am using to learn OOP and Full Stack development. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. 

Thank you!
